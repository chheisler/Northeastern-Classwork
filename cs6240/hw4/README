Code for PageRank can be found in PageRank/

Code can be built and run with 'make run'. Each makefile defines the variables
MASTER, PARALLELISM, PERSIST, INPUT and OUTPUT which are passed as arguments to
the run and can be altered if necessary. MASTER defines the MASTER for the
Spark context, PARALLELISM defines the number of partitions for the job and
PERSIST defines whether or not the RDD's of page links and ranks should be
persisted.
