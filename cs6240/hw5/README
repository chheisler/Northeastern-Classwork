Code for the column-by-row version of PageRank can be found in ColumnPartition/

Code can be built and run with 'make run'. Each makefile defines the variables
INPUT, OUTPUT and NUM_REDUCERS which are passed as arguments to the run and can
be altered if necessary. INPUT should be a directory containing all input files.
The makefile for the row-by-column also has a setting ABSOLUTE which tells
triggers whether or not to use an absolute path from the Java system utilities
when adding part files to the distributed cache.
